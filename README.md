# Space X Travelers Hub (React-Redux Group Project)

- In this project, we worked with the real live data from the SpaceX API, to build a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application will allow users to book rockets and join selected space missions.

- The Space Travelers' Hub consists of Rockets, Missions, and the My Profile section.

## My Profile
The My Profile section displays all reserved rockets and space missions.

## Missions
The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status. There is also a button next to each mission that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier.

## Rockets
The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking.
